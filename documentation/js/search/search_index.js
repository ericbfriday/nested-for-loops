Nx features\nInteractive tutorial\nGenerate your first application\nRun ng g app myapp to generate an application. When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same CLI workspace.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve myapp for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name --project=myapp to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build myapp to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Jest.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Cypress.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching
